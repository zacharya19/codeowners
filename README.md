# codeowners

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that does the same as github codeowners feature but without auto assignment, will just block the PR and comment with list of codeowners.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run the bot
yarn start
```

## TODOs
1. Add unit tests.
2. Watch OWNER file changes to update existing PRs.
3. In case of no codeowners or the PRs submitter is the codeowner need another message.
